📌 Project Overview

MindPatch is a student-centric Digital Detox & Wellness Planner designed to help adolescents manage excessive screen time, academic stress, and emotional well-being.
Instead of strict restrictions, MindPatch uses empathetic design, behavioral science, and gentle AI nudges to promote healthier digital habits.

🎯 Problem Statement

Students aged 13–18 face:

Excessive screen time (7–9 hours/day outside academics)

Digital fatigue and emotional burnout

Reduced focus and sleep quality

Academic stress amplified by digital overload

Existing wellness apps are either too passive, not student-focused, or lack emotional + screen-time integration.

🔍 Research & Empathy (Stage 1)
📊 Key Research Insights

High Screen Usage: Strong correlation with anxiety, low mood, and fatigue

Academic Stress: Over 60% of students report stress due to exams & deadlines

Behavioral Loops:
Stress → Phone Usage → Temporary Relief → Guilt → More Stress
